# ScribersHive

## What

A blogging platform for young people to voice their opinions and spark discussion on the topics that matter to them most.

The aim of this project is to re-design the current [Scribers Hive site](http://www.scribershive.com/) and implement the following new features:
+ the ability to follow bloggers
+ ...

## How

Rebuild the frontend and use the Wordpress API to GET and POST blog data.

## Tech

We're using:
+ [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
+ ...

### Installation

Run `npm install` to install any node modules.

Make sure you have [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) installed. If you're on a MAC:

`gem install sass`

Build the CSS file:
`npm run sass-watch`

Now anytime you update style.scss you'll get a new style.css built.
